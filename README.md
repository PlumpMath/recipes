## Try it

At some times, it might be [live](http://papill0n.org:3000/docs), but
running at home is much cooler anyway:

    $ lein ring server

Then your browser should have a [new page open](http://localhost:3000)
and you could have a look at [all recipes](http://localhost:3000) or [our
speciality](http://localhost:3000/Apple pie).

Have fun!
